      You may think this looks like a regular site, and **you are right**. We wanted to create a site using modern tools and techniques, including Server Side Rendering (SSR) and run it in a particular environment.

      - It's based on modern frameworks and tools: [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
      - It prerenders the initial content using [Server Side Rendering (SSR)](https://web.dev/rendering-on-the-web/)
      - The SSR logic runs inside a WebAssembly module by embedding the [QuickJS](https://bellard.org/quickjs/) runtime (using [Javy](https://github.com/Shopify/javy))
      - The WebAssembly runtime we used is [Wazero](https://wazero.io/)
      - **It runs in a [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) (BCM2835 / ARM 32-Bits 1GHz)**

      Everything brought to you by the Wasm Labs @ VMware OCTO team.
